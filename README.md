# Concourse CI bootstrap

Quickly bootstrap your project with Concourse by running the `bootstrap.sh` in your project root.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danrspencer/concourse-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash /dev/stdin
```

This should install everything you need to get up and running with Concourse, start the Vagrant box and setup a basic pipeline!
