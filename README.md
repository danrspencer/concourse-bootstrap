# Concourse CI bootstrap

Quickly bootstrap your Concourse project by running the `bootstrap.sh` in your project root.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danrspencer/concourse-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash /dev/stdin
```

The bootstrap script assumes you already have Vagrant installed. If you don't use the following commands to install it:

```
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
```
