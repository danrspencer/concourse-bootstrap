# Concourse CI bootstrap

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danrspencer/concourse-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash /dev/stdin
```

The bootstrap script assumes you already have Vagrant installed. If you don't use the following commands to install it:

```
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
```

It can also be worth installing `vagrant-manager` to help 

```
brew cask install Vagrant-Manager manage your Vagrant boxes
```
